## JShell
Those of you who are new to Java programming, could take advantage of "JShell" which is often helpful for trying out the code snippets.<br>
JDK 9 and above include this tool that lets you execute a snippet of Java code instead of writing a full Java program.<br>
* For Beginners -> Practice and Learn the syntax
* For Developers -> Execute part of program in simple way
  
JShell is a `Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop` (**REPL**), which evaluates declarations, statements, and expressions as they are entered and immediately shows the 
results.<br>
## Why use JShell?
Jshell has reduced all the efforts that are required to run a Java program and test a business logic.<br>
If we don’t use Jshell, creating of Java program involves the following steps.<br>
* Open editor and write program
* Save the program
* Compile the program
* Edit if any compile time error
* Run the program
* Edit if any runtime error
* Repeat the process
  
Jshell does not require above steps. We can evaluate statements, methods and classes, even can write hello program without creating class.<br>
JShell helps you try out code and easily explore options as you develop your program.<br>
